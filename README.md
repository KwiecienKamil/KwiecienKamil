<h3>I ❤️ CODING</h3>


<h4>I played football in club for 8 years, last 3 years was injury after injury,
to this day something is wrong with my knee and I can't play anymore. After I left the club, next year was probably the worst year in aspect of mental health, I didn't
know what I was gonna do with my life, I was in IT high school but I thought
I'm too dumb to become programmer. I had exam at the end of 3rd year in high school,
that was creating layout on website, sql commands, configurating router, installing hard drive. After creating that website I thought "I'm studying like 2 months 
and I can create website, what I'm gonna build after 1 year". That was the first 
time I thought wow maybe I can do that. After that I'm completly addicted to creating websites, I still remember feeling after creating first one from scratch I was really moved and happy</h4>
