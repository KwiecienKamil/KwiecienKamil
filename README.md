### 🤵 KwiecienKamil

**`Passionate self-taught Developer😁`**

I'm ambitous coder with addiction to improving. As a former footballer
I'm trying to move to coding everything that I've learnt playing football. 
From training every day to psychological aspects to coding. I love coding
and I want to be better person/coder every single day.
